# **Security Vulnerability Detection Framework**

## **Project Overview**
### **Introduction**
This project aims to develop a framework for detecting and mitigating security vulnerabilities in operating systems. It focuses on threats such as buffer overflows, trapdoors, and cache poisoning, providing real-time alerts and suggesting countermeasures.

### **Goals and Expected Outcomes**
- Detect and mitigate **security vulnerabilities** in operating systems.
- Simulate **buffer overflow, trapdoors, and cache poisoning** attacks.
- Provide **real-time alerts** and **recommend countermeasures**.

## **Module-Wise Breakdown**
### **1. Attack Simulation Module**
- Simulates security threats (e.g., buffer overflows, trapdoors).
- Collects logs for analysis.

### **2. Detection and Mitigation Module**
- Uses **Machine Learning (ML) models** for anomaly detection.
- Provides **automated security recommendations**.

### **3. User Interface and Visualization Module**
- Displays **real-time alerts, attack logs, and system status**.
- Offers **interactive visualizations** for easy monitoring.

## **Functionalities**
### **1. Attack Simulation Functionalities**
- Simulate buffer overflow and log memory access violations.
- Generate synthetic trapdoor attacks for detection.

### **2. Detection and Mitigation Functionalities**
- Train an ML model to detect **attack patterns**.
- Provide **automated alerts and recommendations**.

### **3. User Interface Functionalities**
- Display **security metrics and attack statistics** in real time.
- Allow users to **review logs and implement mitigation steps**.

## **Technology Used**
### **Programming Languages**
- Python (for attack simulation & ML)
- JavaScript (for web-based UI)

### **Libraries and Tools**
- `scikit-learn`, `TensorFlow` (for ML-based threat detection)
- `pwn`, `scapy` (for attack simulation)
- `Flask`, `Dash` (for web-based visualization)

### **Other Tools**
- **GitHub** (version control)
- **Snort** (Intrusion Detection System)
